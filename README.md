## Description of the Project

Online Store is a user-friendly e-commerce platform designed to 
provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. 
The app features a Store Home Screen with options to display products, 
manage the cart, and exit. Customers can search, filter, and add 
products to their cart in the Display Products section. The Display Cart section allows

with timestamps in a Receipts folder.
